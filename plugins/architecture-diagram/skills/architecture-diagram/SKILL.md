# gmdiagram — Architecture Diagram Skill

## What This Skill Does

Generate publication-quality diagrams as standalone files. The output can be:
- **HTML**: Single `.html` file with inline SVG and embedded CSS (default, no JavaScript)
- **SVG**: Standalone `.svg` file
- **Mermaid**: Mermaid text syntax (paste into GitHub, Notion, etc.)
- **PNG/PDF**: Via the export script at `scripts/export.sh`

## Diagram Type Selection

When the user describes a system, determine the diagram type:

| User Intent | Diagram Type | Reference File |
|---|---|---|
| System layers, tiers, services, infrastructure, platform | `architecture` | `references/diagram-architecture.md` |
| Process flow, decision tree, algorithm, branching logic | `flowchart` | `references/diagram-flowchart.md` |
| Brainstorm, topic hierarchy, feature tree, learning roadmap | `mindmap` | `references/diagram-mindmap.md` |
| Database tables, entities, relationships, data model | `er` | `references/diagram-er.md` |
| Message flow, API calls, protocol, interaction between actors | `sequence` | `references/diagram-sequence.md` |

If unsure, default to `architecture`. Read the diagram-type-registry at `references/diagram-type-registry.md` for detailed trigger keywords.

## Two-Step Generation Process

ALWAYS follow these two steps in order. Never skip to output directly.

### Step 1: Generate JSON Schema

Read the user's description and extract structure into the JSON schema for the selected diagram type. Each type has its own schema file in `assets/`:

| Diagram Type | Schema File |
|---|---|
| `architecture` | `assets/schema-architecture.json` |
| `flowchart` | `assets/schema-flowchart.json` |
| `mindmap` | `assets/schema-mindmap.json` |
| `er` | `assets/schema-er.json` |
| `sequence` | `assets/schema-sequence.json` |

Key rules across all types:
- Every component gets a unique `id` (kebab-case)
- Use semantic `type` values as defined in each schema
- If the user doesn't specify a style, use `dark-professional`
- If the user doesn't specify a format, use `html`
- Components can reference icons via the `"icon"` field (see `references/icons-catalog.md`)

Output the JSON first, then proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Generate Output

Read the diagram-type reference file for generation instructions:

1. **Choose template**: Based on the `style` field, read the corresponding style reference and template:
   - `dark-professional` → `references/style-dark-professional.md` → `assets/template-dark.html`
   - `hand-drawn` → `references/style-hand-drawn.md` → `assets/template-sketch.html`
   - `light-corporate` → `references/style-light-corporate.md` → `assets/template-light-corporate.html`
   - `cyberpunk-neon` → `references/style-cyberpunk-neon.md` → `assets/template-cyberpunk-neon.html`
   - `blueprint` → `references/style-blueprint.md` → `assets/template-blueprint.html`
   - `warm-cozy` → `references/style-warm-cozy.md` → `assets/template-warm-cozy.html`

2. **Compute layout**: Follow the coordinate calculation rules in the diagram-type-specific layout file.

3. **Build SVG**: Use the component SVG snippets from the diagram-type-specific components file.

4. **Wrap in HTML** (if format=html): Use the corresponding template file as the starting structure.

For other formats:
- **SVG**: Follow `references/output-svg.md` — extract standalone SVG
- **Mermaid**: Follow `references/output-mermaid.md` — transform JSON to Mermaid text
- **PNG/PDF**: First generate HTML or SVG, then run `scripts/export.sh` (see `references/output-png-pdf.md`)

## Design Principles

1. **Diagrams should argue, not just display** — every element should contribute to understanding
2. **Structure first, aesthetics second** — correct relationships matter more than visual polish
3. **Label everything meaningful** — connections need labels, components need names
4. **Consistency over creativity** — use the defined color system, don't invent new colors
5. **No JavaScript** — the output must work without any scripting (HTML/SVG formats)
6. **Escape all user text** — HTML-entity-escape `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'` in all labels, titles, and descriptions before inserting into SVG/HTML to prevent XSS

## Style Decision Guide

| Situation | Recommended style |
|-----------|------------------|
| Technical article, documentation | `dark-professional` |
| Presentation, slide deck | `dark-professional` |
| Whiteboard/teaching context | `hand-drawn` |
| Blog post with casual tone | `hand-drawn` |
| Enterprise architecture review | `light-corporate` |
| Stakeholder/business presentation | `light-corporate` |
| Developer tool, CLI product | `cyberpunk-neon` |
| Futuristic/tech-forward content | `cyberpunk-neon` |
| Engineering spec, technical drawing | `blueprint` |
| Infrastructure/SRE documentation | `blueprint` |
| Educational content, tutorial | `warm-cozy` |
| Non-technical audience, friendly docs | `warm-cozy` |

## Iteration Workflow

After generating the initial diagram, the user may request changes:
- Add/remove components → update JSON, recompute layout
- Change a connection → update JSON connections, recompute paths
- Change style → switch template, keep same JSON
- Change diagram type → re-extract JSON for new type, regenerate
- Change output format → regenerate from existing JSON

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] JSON validates against the diagram type's schema
- [ ] All text is readable (no overlapping labels)
- [ ] Connection lines don't pass through unrelated components
- [ ] Layout is symmetric and balanced
- [ ] ViewBox fits all content (no clipping, no excessive whitespace)
- [ ] Legend matches the component types used
- [ ] Title and subtitle are accurate
- [ ] Icons (if used) are correctly colored and positioned
